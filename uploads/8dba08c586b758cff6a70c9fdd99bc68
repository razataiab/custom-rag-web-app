The Co-operative brand is also bigger than just food and grocery delivery, you also provide services for insurance, funeral care, and legal advice. A key difference from other brands, such as other retail stores, is that a co-operative (co-op) is a unique type of company. I am aware that individual members and other co-ops own your cooperative, not large investors, and your members have a voice in how you operate.
